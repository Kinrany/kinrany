### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I sometimes start side projects. This account has ~30 public repos (that aren't forks), most of them are junk. Here's a list of those that may be worth reading or using.

### Vue-p5

[Kinrany/vue-p5](https://github.com/Kinrany/vue-p5) is a library I wrote in university that combines multimedia with web UI. It is intended for web games and interactive graphical prototyping. Concretely, it wraps [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) in a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) component.

There are 100+ Github stars and 300+ [projects that depend on it](https://github.com/Kinrany/vue-p5/network/dependents), so I'm happy to say that other people also liked the idea. I haven't been making many games in the last few years so the project could really use a facelift at this point.
